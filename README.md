# Welcome to the Sligo IQ Quiz site.

This is a simple Quiz front-end website, designed to ask user 5 questions at the end of the quiz to show the result. I tried to check how much the user knows about Sligo.

### User Interface:

This is a simple Quiz website, The Background has a dark image. In the middle app section, Users will be asked a question and select an answer from three multiple choices.

If the User selects an answer, the rest of the buttons will be disabled and the next button will pop up.

If the User selects the correct answer, the button will become Green colour.

If the User selects the incorrect answer, the button will become Red colour and the correct answer will be shown as Green colour.

### Next Button:

After selecting the correct or incorrect answers, Users will be asked to click the Next button. This will change the question and the Answers and wait for the User to select again.

If the User answers the last question, the Next Button will change to the Finish button with a different message, which depends on the Score.

### Score:

If the User answers all correct answers, the background of the page will change and the Next Button message will change to "Ask your friend to try". If the User clicks on the Button the whole page will start from the beginning. 

When the User can answer at least 3 questions correctly, the Next Button message will change to "Try again" and a Message will show to the user to visit Sligo. And the background will change to a Blue colour.

Same as the last two states depend on the Score, if the User can answer less than 3 answers correctly, the button will change to "Visit Sligo and try again". And the background will change to Red colour.

## Software:
I used Visual Studio Code to construct the website and used HTML and CSS. I also used Google Chrome to test the website.

## Deployment:
The website is deployed in GitHub, and it is available to visit for all users [here.](https://mnalrashid.github.io/Portfolio-Project-2/)

## Credits:
I have taken ideas and content from multiple websites.

## Validator:

- Used W3C to validate HTML. No error was found.

- Used Jigsaw to validate CSS. No error was found.

- Used Jshint to validate JavaScript, 15 warnings generated for not supported ES6 (Mozilla JS extensions (use moz)).
